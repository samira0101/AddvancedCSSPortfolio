# AddvancedCSSPortfolio


## Description
<!-- What was your motivation? -->

The motivation behind this file is so that I start building a portfolio and able to link it to my github projects. 

<!-- Why did you build this project? -->
This is the starting of my career in tech as it is a profile that will be viewed by recruiters. It will show how much improvement I gained throughout the course. 


<!-- What did you learn? -->

Now that Phase 1 has been completed I have learned the front end of web development. It was not an easy route however with practise I realised I am able to understand certain concepts, expecially with javascript. I have also used third party api's for the project which did come to a halt as there were many issues surrounding that however, we were able to come up with the solution and create our platform for proect 1. I realised that working collaborative is very important as to communicate and learn from one another.
