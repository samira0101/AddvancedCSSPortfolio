# AddvancedCSSPortfolio


## Description
<!-- What was your motivation? -->

The motivation behind this html file is so that I start building a portfolio and able to link it to my github projects. 

<!-- Why did you build this project? -->
This is the starting of my career in tech as it is a profile that will be viewed by recruiters. It will show how much improvement I gained throughout the course. 


<!-- What did you learn? -->

I have learnt that being stubborn and not taking a breaks away from coding would make me miss the most smallest thing and be stuck on it for many hours. I saw many profiles that were very creative. It required more advanced skills in which will be built throughout my career. I had to create many containers/div/classes in html to target certain areas on css also learnt about media queries, flex, linking. I have still not finshed but will continue to build it over the next months.
